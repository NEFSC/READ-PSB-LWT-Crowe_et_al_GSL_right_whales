ABSTRACT:
North Atlantic right whales _Eubalaena glacialis_ are most commonly observed along
the eastern seaboard of North America; however, their distribution and occupancy patterns have
become less predictable in the last decade. This study explored the individual right whales captured
photographically from both dedicated and opportunistic sources from 2015 to 2019 in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL), an area previously understudied for right whale presence. A total of
187 individuals, including reproductive females, were identified from all sources over this period.
In years when more substantial survey effort occurred (2017−2019), similar numbers of individuals
were sighted (mean = 133, SD = 1.5), and dedicated mark−recapture aerial surveys were highly
effective at capturing almost all of the whales estimated in the region (2019: _N_ = 137, 95% CI =
135−147). A high rate of inter-annual return was observed between all 5 study years, with 95% of
the animals seen in 2019 sighted previously. Capture rates indicated potential residencies as long
as 5 mo, and observed behaviors included feeding and socializing. Individuals were observed in
the northern and southern GSL, regions divided by a major shipping corridor. Analyses suggest
that individuals mostly moved less than 9.1 km d−1, although rates of up to 79.8 km d−1 were also
calculated. The GSL is currently an important habitat for 40% of this Critically Endangered species,
which underscores how crucial protection measures are in this area.
